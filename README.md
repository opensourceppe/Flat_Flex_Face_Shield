# Flat_Flex_Face_Shield
Face shield from all flat flexible materials -- grommets or staples at temples -- no 3D printed headband required

Welcome to the Open Source PPE Makers meetup group!
If those of us who are capable of making PPE do not step up and do something, many will suffer needlessly.
We want to make sure the work product we produce can be replicated efficiently to help as many as possible as early as possible.

These are plans for an all-flat face shield made from flexible materials, no 3D printer required.
Less material, lower cost, easier assembly, etc. 

If you have the means to give to our nonprofit so we can continue our work, please do.

ALL funds received will go toward making PPE, and we will continue to make PPE for as much material as we can acquire.

Join our meetup group to learn about other personal protection equipment projects.

Our purpose is to interconnect all volunteers who want to make personal protective equipment (PPE) then get these critical resources to the frontline medical professionals (pathologists, physicians, nurses, caretakers, first responders, etc.) ASAP.

Making something to protect them while they are performing their mission is paramount.

We also need those who have access to materials to join this group. Volunteers will continue to make as much PPE as we have materials for. The more materials we have, the more we can make, plain and simple.

When you see the gratitude medical professionals and first responders have for those who are making PPE to help protect them, it will change your life.

If you see other open source projects you would like to recommend to the meetup group, be sure to contact the organizer so we can all work together and help others who may be struggling in their protection endeavors.
We look forward to meeting you.
